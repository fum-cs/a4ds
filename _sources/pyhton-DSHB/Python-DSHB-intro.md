# Foundation from the Python Data Science Handbook

This initial part of the course covers the fundamental tools required for data science in Python. The content directly corresponds to the first four chapters of Jake VanderPlas's excellent book, the **Python Data Science Handbook (PDSH)**.

Instead of reproducing the material here, we strongly encourage you to study these chapters directly from the source. They are considered essential prerequisites for the subsequent sections of this course.
